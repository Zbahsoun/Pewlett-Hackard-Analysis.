# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the project

We will be helping Pewlett Hackard company in data modeling, engineering and analysis for 2 purposes. First, to offer retirement packages for those who meet certain criteria, and to know how many positions will need to be filled in the future. We will be using SQL to import and export data for analysis purposes. The final challenge is focused on creating queries to summarize the number of retiring employees butheir current job title and the list of employees elibigle for a mentorship program for retiring employees.

At the start, we had 6 CSV files diagrammed by column headers and relationships in the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) as shown below. Afterwards we created databases linked by primary and secodary keys to be able to write and run queries to export several other data tables as CSV files.

## Results

Below are the main points found after analyzing the data output:

- A big number of employees retiring have senior positions. 29414 Senior Engineers and 28254 Senior Staff, this means Pewlett Hackard company will have to find replacements for these positions, this will need planning and will take a lot of time and resources to be able to cover this big number of retired employees. 
- Only 2 managers will be retiring which will save the company time and resources to find or train for leadership positions. 
- Out of 90,398 retired employees, only 1549 employees are qualified for the mentorship program, which is considered a small number compared to the total number or retired employees.
